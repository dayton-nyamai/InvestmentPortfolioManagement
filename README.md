# InvestmentPortfolioManagement
This repository  aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and techniques for managing investment portfolios. Whether you are an 
individual investor or a financial professional, this project will help you analyze, optimize, and manage your portfolios effectively.

## Key Features

### 1.  Key Statistics Analysis
The first step in portfolio management is to analyze the key statistics of the assets in your portfolio. This project provides a set of functions
to calculate important metrics such as mean return, standard deviation, correlation, and covariance. These statistics will help you understand the
historical performance and risk characteristics of your assets.

### 2.  Normality Test
Before proceeding with portfolio optimization, it is crucial to check the normality assumption of asset returns. This project includes various normality
tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Jarque-Bera test. By assessing the normality of asset returns, you can make informed decisions about the
appropriate optimization techniques to use.

### 3. Portfolio Optimization
Portfolio optimization is a key component of portfolio management. This project offers different optimization methods, including mean-variance
optimization, minimum variance optimization, and risk parity optimization. You can customize the optimization process by specifying constraints such
as target return, target risk, and asset allocation limits.

### 4.  Efficient Frontier Analysis
The efficient frontier represents the set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given
level of return. This project allows you to construct and visualize the efficient frontier using various optimization techniques. By exploring the efficient
frontier, you can identify the optimal portfolio that maximizes return or minimizes risk based on your preferences.

### 5. Portfolio Analytics
To gain deeper insights into your portfolio, this project provides a range of analytics tools. You can calculate metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio,
and information ratio to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of your portfolio. Additionally, you can assess the diversification benefits of your portfolio using
 metrics like the portfolio diversification ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.

### 6.  Risk Management and Reporting
Effective risk management is crucial for portfolio success. This project offers risk management tools such as value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk
(CVaR) calculations. You can also generate comprehensive risk reports that highlight the risk exposures of your portfolio and provide insights for risk mitigation
strategies. The reporting functionality includes visualizations and summary statistics to facilitate decision-making.
